# Homebrew Third-Party Repositories (TAP) for Open Porous Media (OPM)

**NOTE:** This is work in progress!

## How do I install these formulae?

```bash
brew install SoilRos/OPM/<formula>
```

Or

```bash
brew tap SoilRos/OPM
brew install <formula>
```

Where `<formula>` is one of the following packages:

| Formula | Versions (**default**) | Options |
| ------- | ---------------------| -------- |
| `type-lite`           | **0.2.0**       |
| `resinsight`          | <none>  | `--head` |

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
